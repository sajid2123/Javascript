###JavaScript
The Git repository I created houses a comprehensive collection of notes I compiled during my journey of learning JavaScript. These notes serve as a valuable resource, capturing key concepts, techniques, and best practices related to JavaScript programming. The repository employs Git, a version control system, to effectively manage the evolution of these notes over time.
