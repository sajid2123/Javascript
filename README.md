# Javascript

This repository contains my JavaScript projects, which I am building while learning JavaScript.

## Description

The projects are structured to cover various aspects, including basic syntax,data types, functions, loops, conditionals, and object-oriented programming concepts.

Through these projects, i am building a strong foundation in JavaScript and gaining the confidence to apply my knowledge to more complex coding tasks.

The ultimate goal is to empower my foundational JavaScript concepts to more advanced programming techniques, fostering a deep and comprehensive understanding of the language and its capabilities.
